## General Properties

* Determinant is a property that can be searched for only square $n$ x $n$ matrices. It helps to associate a square matrix with a scalar 
value that tell us whether the matrix is regular (invertible) or not. 

* Determinant of orthogonal matrices is equal to either $1$ or $-1$. 

* One of most common determinant applications is homogeneous system of linear equations. If we have a set of linear equations, all of 
which is equal to zero, we call it as homogeneous system. These linear systems are represented in $Ax = 0$ form, and have at least one 
solution, known as zero (trivial solution). At this point, we generally check the determinant of matrix $A$:

$$det(A) \neq 0 \\,\\, \rightarrow \\,\\, unique \\,\\, solution \\, (x = 0) $$

$$det(A) = 0 \\,\\, \rightarrow \\,\\, infinite \\,\\, solutions $$
