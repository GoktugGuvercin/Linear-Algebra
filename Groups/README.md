## Introduction to Groups and Manifolds

In mathematics, a group is a non-empty set associated with an operator. Any two elements from this group can be combined by the
operator to derive other group elements. Every set cannot be a group; it has to satisfy $3$ main conditions: 

1) The group operator has to be associative.
2) An identity element defined for that operator should exist in the set.
3) Every element in the group should possess an inverse that can be derived by the operator.


Groups are abstract mathematical objects working with binary operations at the top of special properties. However, if the group
together with its operator satisfies the continuity condition for its properties, it becomes ***topological group***. Topological groups
are actually the combination of groups and topological spaces. In other words, each topological group refers to a space. For example,
real numbers form a topological group under *addition* operator. On the other hand, this is not the case for integer numbers; instead
they comprise a discrete group lacking continuity. The main difference between discrete and topological groups is the continuity 
condition itself. When you pick up an item from a discrete group, its neighborhood only contains that element itself, which proves to be
lack of continuity. 

$$ Z = \\{- \infty, \cdots, -3, -2, -1, 0, \\, 1, \\, 2, \\, 3, \cdots, \infty \\} $$

$$ Element \\,\\,\\, a = 1 $$

$$ One \\,\\, Neighborhood \\,\\, of \\,\\, Element \\,\\,\\, a = [0.5, 1.5] $$

$$b \not \subset [0.5, 1.5] \\,\\,\\, \forall b \in Z$$

In mathematics, each manifold is actually a topological space where its local regions can be mapped into Euclidean space by preserving
its topological properties. In other words, if you have an n-dimensional manifold, it is a topological space with the property that 
each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space. The groups intersect with 
manifolds at this point. Namely, if the group has a continuous topology, with the simplest words, it becomes a manifold.
